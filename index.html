           <p>Some of the most beautiful flowers are:</P>
                  <ul>
                        <li><h1>Lilac</h1>
   <p>Many count the lilac among their favorite flowers. The bold purple coloring and elegant white outline imbue
 the flower with a regal look, plus the elongated petals add to the uniqueness of the presentation.</p></li>
                   
                        <li><h1>Iris</h1>
   <p>The iris flower looks as though it was meticulously designed by a skilled artist. Perhaps that’s why it was
 a favorite subject of Impressionist painter Claude Monet. Splashes of blue, purple, yellow, and white make for a
 truly unforgettable artistic arrangement.</p></li>
                  
                        <li><h1>Dahlia</h1>
   <p>The dahlia is one of the lushest and most vibrant flowers you’ll find, available in a rainbow of colors
 ranging from pink and red to orange or white. Some dahlia petals even have stunning color gradients, like bright
 reds that gradually fade into soft whites or gorgeous purples that lighten from stem to tip.</p></li>
                   
                        <li><h1>Bird-of-Paradise</h1>
   <p>The bird-of-paradise is so named because it resembles a brightly colored bird, complete with fluttering
 wings and a slender body. Vibrant oranges, reds, and blues make up the impressive “wingspan,” and the colors
 really come alive in the sunlight.</p></li>
                  
                        <li><h1>Water Lily</h1>
  <p>It’s no surprise that the water lily would provide inspiration for Claude Monet's visual artistry. This
 flower has a beauty and symmetry that’s seldom seen, plus the radiant colors almost seem to have their own glow.
</p></li>

                        <li><h1>Marigold</h1>
   <p>A bright red and orange marigold set against a lush green garden may be one of the most beautiful sight
 nature has to offer. The golden hue of the flower becomes more incredible the closer you get. The unique ridges
 along the petals, the rich yet subtle color variations, and the cornucopia of shapes give the marigold an almost
 hypnotic beauty.</p></li>
                        <li><h1>Lotus</h1>
    <p>The lotus almost doesn’t seem real. The outward-reaching petals radiate with vibrant shades of pink and white
 , while the golden stamen in the center provides a focal point that brings the whole presentation together. The
 petals are almost perfectly symmetrical in size, and the highlighted tips add incredible dimension and character.</p></li>

                        <li><h1>Rose</h1>
  <p>The elegantly curling and overlapping petals, the bold coloration, and the diverse array of colors truly make
 the rose the ultimate flower. Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Paul Cézanne are just some of the iconic
 artists who have incorporated the rose into their works. If you’re looking for the perfect bouquet to say, 
“I love you," “I miss you,” or “Congratulations,” you can't do better than the rose.</p></li>

                        <li><h1>Cherry Blossom</h1>
      <p>The cherry blossom might be Japan’s national flower, but it’s loved all over the world. Up close, the 
 delicate petals are a gorgeous sight to behold—although the beauty of the flowers really becomes apparent from a
 distance.When you look at thousands of flourishing cherry blossoms on a tree, you feel like you’ve been whisked 
 away to some incredible wonderland.</p></li>

                        <li><h1>Orchid</h1>
      <p>The orchid is in a class by itself on account of its unique shape and bold color combinations. Whereas
 many flowers combine colors using gradients and highlights, the orchid plays by its own rules. The gorgeous colors
 are arranged in wild and unpredictable ways, but the result is always astonishing.</p></li>
